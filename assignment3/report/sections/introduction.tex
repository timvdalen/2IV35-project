\section{Introduction}
	The goal of the assignment is to implement an interactive application from a dataset. 
	The focus in this assignmentclies on interaction, multiple views, and the exploratory analysis process.
	We have chosen a dataset with information about all movies.
	The dataset contains the information from IMDb.
	We will describe the dataset in Section~\ref{Sec:Dat}.
	After that we will analyse what could be of interest to an analyst in Section~\ref{Sec:Tas}.
	We will then consider various interactive visualization techniques that support these tasks in Section~\ref{Sec:Des}.
	We have chosen to build our own interactive application.
	We will describe how we build this application in Section~\ref{Sec:Imp}.
	Finally, we will evaluate how well the application works for the tasks we thought that were interesting. 
	This will be described in Section~\ref{Sec:Dis}.
