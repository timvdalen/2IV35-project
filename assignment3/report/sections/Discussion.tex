\subsection{Trend analysis of genres over time }
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{How popular is this genre?}
We will answer this question for the genre: Music.\\
When we look at the streamgraph wihtout filters and just highlight music. 
When we look at Figure~\ref{fig:disc1a}, we  see that see that the number of movies produced with music as a genre is pretty stable. 
When we look at  Figure~\ref{fig:disc1b} we can compare it with other genres and how many of them were produced in 2014. 
It is easy to see how popular that genre is and also see how popular it is  in comparision with other and genres. 
We think our visualization answers this question good enough.

\item \textbf{Is this genre becoming more popular again?}
We will answer this question for the genre: Short.\\
When we look at the popularity of short in Figure~\ref{fig:disc2a}, we can see that it became popular again around  between 1990 and 2000.
We can also see this in the genre popularity view when we click on Short. 
In Figure~\ref{fig:disc2b} you can clearly see that the popularity of short movies did became more popular around 1990. 
We think our visualization answers this question good enough.

		\end{figure}

\item \textbf{When did this genre become popular for the first time?} 
We will answer this question for the genre: Musical.\\
When you click on musical you can see the genre popularity view as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:disc3}
As you can see in this view, musicals became popular for the first time around 1930.
We think our visualization answers this question good enough.

\subsection{Perceived quality of genres over time }
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Does this genre gets better ratings than before? }
We will answer this question for the genre: Comedy.\\
When you click on comedy in the streamgraph and look at the rating view, which is shown in  Figure~\ref{fig:disc4}.
In this view you can see that the average rating of comedy is going up again. 
We think our visualization answers this question good enough. 
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{{dic_4}}
			\caption{Average rating of comedy movies}
			\label{fig:disc4}
		\end{figure}
\item \textbf{Did this genre got a higher average rating for a longer time?}
We will answer this question for the genre: Family.\\
When you click on family in the streamgraph and look at the rating view, which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:disc5}.
You can see that the average rating dropped between 1960 and 1970.
We also found trends like this at other genre, so we think our visualization answers this question good enough. 
		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\includegraphics[width=0.4\textwidth]{{dic_5}}
			\caption{Average rating of family  movies}
			\label{fig:disc5}
		\end{figure}
\item \textbf{Is there a correlation between higher ratings and more produced movies?} 
To answer this question we will look at the following genre: Animation.\\
When you click on family in the streamgraph and look at the rating view, which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:disc6b}.
We see the raiting of animation movies increase around 1970. 
When we then look at the genre popularity view, which is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:disc6b}.
We see that the number of produced movies increases around two years later.  
This means that we can find a correlation between a higher rating and more produced movies.
We found it pretty hard to answer such questions, so we think our visualization is not good enough to answer questions like this.
