\section{Implementation}\label{Sec:Imp}

	Our visualization is implemented for the web platform.
	We use the following technologies:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item HTML (spec v. 5)
		\item CSS (spec v. 3)
		\item SVG
	\end{itemize}

	In order to work more efficiently, we used the following libraries:

	\begin{description}
		\item[D3.js] to generate the SVG graphs
		\item[jQuery] to easily manipulate non-graph DOM elements
		\item[Bootstrap] to rapidly develop a minimal interface
		\item[Bootstrap switch] to add user-friendly switches for settings
	\end{description}

	\subsection{Running}
		Due to security policies in most browsers, the best way to run the application is to start a webserver from the \texttt{application} directory.
		For instance, on a system with Python installed, you can do:

		\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
# Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in a browser
		\end{lstlisting}

		For your convenience, we are also hosting the latest version of this application on \url{http://2IV35.edu.timvdalen.nl/}.

		\subsubsection{Target}
			Due to time constraints and the fact that we wanted to use modern technologies, we were not able to guarantee correctness of the application in all browsers.
			While the application might work fine on other platforms, we recommend using a modern browser based on the WebKit or Blink rendering engines, such as Chrome, Chromium, Safari or later versions of Opera.

	\subsection{Components}
		Our application is built up from Object Oriented JavaScript modules.
		All modules are documented using Doxygen-compatiple documentation.

		The modules all have their own scope and expose certain functionality (methods or objects) to the main scope.
		This way, the modules can use each other by referencing these exported methods and objects from their referenced to the main scope (which is given to each module as an argument).
		In a larger project, we would have used dependency injection instead of polluting the main scope with application-specific classes and methods.
		However, since we only have six modules, we chose to let them expose functionality to the main scope instead of adding the overhead of dependency injection.

		We have the following modules:

		\begin{itemize}
			\item Data
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Municipality
					\item Province
				\end{itemize}
			\item Helpers
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Settings
					\item Filter
				\end{itemize}
			\item Graph
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Main
					\item DetailView
				\end{itemize}
		\end{itemize}

		\subsubsection{Data}
			The following classes represent the data in our application.
			They have methods for easy manipulation and province mechanisms to export the data into GeoJSON suitable for D3.

			\paragraph{Municipality} represents a municipality on the map.
				It has a name, a GeoJSON feature that represents it on a map and some data.
				It exposes a method to get any data for the municipality by key, and a \texttt{getValue} method that returns the main value for the municipality.
				The main value is the one that we use to color the municipality on the map.
				It is built up using a combination of calls to data function.
				Municipality has a static method that returns a new \texttt{Municipality} based on a JSON document.

			\paragraph{Province} represents a province on the map.
				It has a name, a GeoJSON feature, a list of municipalities and an expansion state.
				Note that it does not have data, since there is no province-level data in the data set.
				Based on the expansion state, calling \texttt{getFeature} on a \texttt{Province} will either results in the province's own feature (which is a MultiPolygon of the entire province) or a collection of the features of the municipalities in this province.
				Furthermore, it exposes a \texttt{getValue} function that returns the average of all values in the municipalities in this province, weighted by their population.
				It also provides a method that returns all values, used for determining the minumum and maximum values in the data set.
				The \texttt{Province} class also exposes some static methods that are useful when manipulating a set of provinces.
				The most important one of these is the \texttt{getCollection} method, which returns a GeoJSON \texttt{FeatureCollection} that contains the geographic data for all given provinces (using their expansion state).

		\subsubsection{Helpers}

			\paragraph{Filter} adds a search bar to the document and binds to the value of that input.
				When the filter is setup, the main module gives it a callback that can be used to send new geographical data to the main module.
				When the value of the input bar changes, it searches all instances of \texttt{Province} for municipalities that match by name.
				The matching function is very simple: we check, for each municipality, case insensitive, if the given filter query appears in the municipality name.
				The municipalities that match are then sent to the main module using the given callback.
				Figure~\ref{fig:impl:filter} shows the states of the application before and after typing in the filter bar.

						\caption{After filtering}
						\label{fig:impl:filter:after}
					\end{subfigure}
					\caption{Filtering module}
					\label{fig:impl:filter}
				\end{figure}

			\paragraph{Settings} adds support for end-user settings for the visualization.
				The module has a list of available settings, with for each setting a description, extended description and default value.
				When the settings module is initialized, it generates a HTML DOM node for a form that can be inserted in the page.
				Based on the type of the setting, a different type of form element (using Bootstrap classes) is generated.
				The settings module also binds to change events in the generated form elements, so that any change in the user settings is immediately reflected in the settings state.
				Any other module can access each setting using the \texttt{get} method of \texttt{settings} to get the real-time value of a certain setting.
				We use these settings to give sensible defaults for functionality that might be too restrictive for advanced users.
				Figure~\ref{fig:impl:settings} shows the settings we have defined as JavaScript objects and the resulting generated user interface.

				\begin{figure}[H]
					\centering
					\begin{subfigure}[b]{0.8\textwidth}
						\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{{impl_settings_code}}
						\caption{Settings definition}
						\label{fig:impl:settings:code}

					\\

					\end{subfigure}
					\caption{Settings}
					\label{fig:impl:settings}
				\end{figure}

				Right now, we do not permanently save user settings.
				When the application is reloaded, the default settings are restored.
				If we added settings that have more to do with personal preferences than with temporarily changing the view to explore the data in a different way, it would make sense to store settings in a cookie.
				However, then we would also need to provide a mechanism for resetting to default settings.

		\subsubsection{Graph}
			The Main and DetailView modules are responsible for the graphs that are shown in the application.
			As the name suggests, Main is the program entry.

			\paragraph{Main} loads in the data and converts it to an array of \texttt{Province} instances using the \texttt{fromJSON} function.
				When the data is loaded into our application data classes, the main module gets the GeoJSON features and initializes a D3 SVG map graph in the main graph area.
				It also adds title text and click event handlers to each data element.
				When a data element is clicked, it checks whether that element is a \texttt{Province} or a \texttt{Municipality}.
				In case of a \texttt{Province}, the main module expands the \texttt{Province} and refreshes its data (thereby effectively replacing the province feature by a collection of municipalities).
				In case of a \texttt{Municipality}, the main module calls the DetailView module to display some in-depth information about the selected municipality.

				\begin{figure}[H]
					\centering
					\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{{impl_legend}}
					\caption{Filtering module}
					\label{fig:impl:filter}
				\end{figure}

				Besides the main graph, the main module is also responsible for maintaining the legend, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:impl:legend}.
				The legend is a simple linear gradient that is a graphical representation of the linear color scale that is used to color the map elements.
				Besides the gradient, it also shows the values that correspond to the minimum and maximum colors.
				When the user moves their mouse over an area in the map, the legend shows the location of the value on the scale with a simple one pixel wide bar.
				This makes comparing values easier.

			\paragraph{DetailView} is used to show more information about a municipality, which would not fit in the main view.
				It consists of a horizontal bar chart and it is based on a D3 example for a population pyramid by Stack Overflow user `jshanley', since our initial intention was to show population per gender.
				However, since the data set we were given does not contain the age distribution per gender, we edited the example to only show one side of the pyramid.
				The module exposes a \texttt{showDetail} method that takes a \texttt{Municipality} as the sole argument.
				It uses the data method of the municipality to setup the bar chart and then adds it to the detail view area of the document.
