\section{Implementation}\label{sec:imp}

	Our visualization is implemented for the web platform.
	We use the following technologies:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item HTML (spec v. 5)
		\item CSS (spec v. 3)
		\item SVG
	\end{itemize}

	In order to work more efficiently, we used the following libraries:

	\begin{description}
		\item[D3.js] to generate the SVG graphs
		\item[jQuery] to easily manipulate non-graph DOM elements
		\item[Bootstrap] to rapidly develop a minimal interface
		\item[Bootstrap switch] to add user-friendly switches for settings
	\end{description}

	\subsection{Running}
		Due to security policies in most browsers, the best way to run the application is to start a webserver from the \texttt{application} directory.
		For instance, on a system with Python installed, you can do:

		\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...
# Navigate to http://localhost:8000/ in a browser
		\end{lstlisting}

		For your convenience, we are also hosting the latest version of this application on \url{http://2IV35.edu.timvdalen.nl/}.

		\subsubsection{Target}
			Due to time constraints and the fact that we wanted to use modern technologies, we were not able to guarantee correctness of the application in all browsers.
			While the application might work fine on other platforms, we recommend using a modern browser based on the WebKit or Blink rendering engines, such as Chrome, Chromium, Safari or later versions of Opera.
